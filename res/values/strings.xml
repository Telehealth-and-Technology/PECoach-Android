		<p>When people get upset, it\'s normal to breathe fast or even
		hyperventilate because being upset makes people feel like they need
		more air.</p>
		
		<p>The problem is that breathing fast doesn\'t actually have a
		calming effect. In fact, it usually makes people feel more anxious.</p>
		
		<p>If you took short, quick breaths right now, you would probably feel your
		heart rate going up and you might even start to feel anxious. This fast
		breathing produces bodily reactions that are similar to those of fear
		and anxiety. Therefore, breathing faster can make you more upset.</p>
		
		<p>Instead, when feeling upset or anxious it is better to actually breathe
		slower because slow breathing can reduce feelings of stress or tension.</p>
		
		<p>Most people have some awareness of how breathing affects the way they
		feel. For example, when you are upset, someone might tell you to calm
		down and take a deep breath.  However, deep breathing does not actually
		help calm a person down while slow breathing does. Therefore it is important
		to pause between the exhale and the following inhale. To calm down or
		relax, you need to take normal breaths and slow your exhale, pausing in
		between. It\'s the exhale and pause that are important to relaxing, not inhaling.</p>

    <string name="breathing_retrainer_watch_demo_content">        <![CDATA[
		<p>What you are going to do now is just take a normal breath in through
		your nose and then extend your exhale. Your inhale will be normal, it\'s
		the exhale that you are going to slow down. With the exhale, some people
		like to think the word "relax" in their head, or another calming word,
		but for our practice now we are simply going to count out the exhale. When
		you practice this later, you might want to think a calming word in your head
		and extend the word for the length of the count. After the exhale, you
		will pause for 3 to 4 counts before inhaling again.</p>
		
		<p>Let\'s practice this. First, take a normal breath in through your nose;
		now exhale through your mouth, lengthen your exhale and count in your
		head for.. 1. 2. 3. 4. Pause,  and count in your head
		1. 2. 3. 4. Again, now inhale normally. Exhale and 1. 2. 3. 4.
		Pause. 2. 3. 4. Inhale normally. exhale. 2. 3. 4. pause. 2. 3. 4.</p>
		
		<p>Under the "Practice" screen, you are going to see a visual that reminds you
		of when to inhale and how long to exhale and pause. If this visual is
		either too fast or slow for you, you can control that by moving the "speed up"
		and "slow down" buttons at the bottom of the screen. It won\'t slow it down or speed
		it up too much because we want you to get use to doing this within a
		certain range. The practice will last for 10 Minutes; you should do this
		3 times a day.</p>

		<P><b>How does exposure work?</b>
				<P>Immediately following a traumatic event, most people have reactions including nervousness and anxiety, 
				sleep problems, and being upset by reminders of the event.  For some people, these symptoms naturally decrease over time.  
				But for others, these symptoms continue to be a problem and they develop posttraumatic stress disorder.  
				Two factors maintain the PTSD symptoms: avoidance and unhelpful thoughts and beliefs.
            
            	<P>There are two kinds of avoidance: avoiding thinking about the trauma and avoiding situations that remind the person of the trauma.  
            	People avoid in order to reduce their anxiety and distress about the trauma.
				
				<P>The problem is that avoidance works in the short run to reduce distress and anxiety.  
				But in the long run it actually make the problems worse because it interferes with recovery.  
				Exposure works to help you recover by confronting the situations that distress you in a safe way.  
				We want you to learn two important lessons from exposure: 1) your distress and anxiety will decrease if you stay with 
				the thoughts or in the situation long enough and 2) the negative things you think will happen during exposure actually 
				don\'t happen.
				
				<P>This treatment, Prolonged Exposure, uses two forms of exposure.  
				The first is called imaginal exposure, and involves revisiting the traumatic memory and recounting it aloud.  
				The second is called in vivo exposure, and involves confronting the objectively safe activities that you have been 
				avoiding because of the trauma in a gradual manner, beginning with the easier ones and progressing towards more difficult ones.
				
				<P>Exposure works in several ways.  First, revisiting and recounting your traumatic memories in imagination help you 
				emotionally work through the traumatic event and think about what happened and about your behavior differently.  
				Second, exposure helps you learn that memories cannot actually harm you, and that feeling upset or anxious is not dangerous. 
                Third, exposure helps you learn that you CAN handle feelings of anxiety and distress, causing you to gain confidence 
                in your ability to handle stress.  Fourth, exposure helps you learn that the more you approach difficult but relatively
                 safe activities, the more feelings of anxiety and distress are reduced.  In other words, the more you do it, the easier 
                 it gets!  We call this habituation.
				
				<P>Habituation means that by approaching situations and objects that cause you to be upset again and again and by 
				sticking it out these situations no longer make you upset. This is because you learn that nothing bad happens to 
				you while being in these situations. No one is hurting you and you are able to cope with your emotions. It is similar 
				to getting back on a bicycle after falling off.  If you refuse to try again, over time you become more and more frightened 
				of riding bicycles.  But if you force yourself to ride them despite your fear, you become less afraid.
				
				<P>Habituation works with upsetting memories too.  Allowing yourself to think about the traumatic memories rather than 
				avoiding them will help you to remember the trauma with less distress.  It will also allow you to gain control over 
				those memories so that they are less likely to pop up at times you don\'t want them to.  The flashbacks, nightmares 
				and intrusive thoughts that many trauma survivors often experience are less likely to occur after you repeatedly revisit 
				the memory of the trauma.  And when they do occur, they are less upsetting. 
				
				<P>Treatment with imaginal and in vivo exposure may seem difficult at first.  But with time you will find that this 
				treatment becomes easier and will make you feel better about yourself in many ways.

    <string name="common_reactions_content">        <![CDATA[
		People differ in how they react to a traumatic experience but certain reactions are common. Remember that after a trauma, 
		it is natural to feel upset and stressful. But it\'s when the stress symptoms don\'t fade over time and when they interfere 
		with everyday life that the person has Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Immediately following a trauma, it\'s very normal 
		to have severe reactions. Many people start to feel better within weeks or up to three months and others recover more slowly. 
		But some don\'t recover without help. It is generally helpful to everyone, no matter what the recovery length, to become more 
		aware of the changes that can happen after a trauma in order to recover. 
		
		<P>The primary symptoms of PTSD are fear and anxiety. During a traumatic event, fear and anxiety are normal. But it is when this 
		fear and anxiety don\'t go away, or come back, that problems start. When anxiety lasts long after the trauma it can change your 
		view of the world, your sense of being safe, or even your feelings of being able to control your life. Things that remind you 
		of the trauma can trigger anxiety and the feeling of danger, like certain places, times of day, certain smells, or any situation 
		that reminds you of the trauma. Sometimes these feelings come out of the blue without any trigger. Life itself can start to 
		feel dangerous; things that normally won\'t have bothered you before the trauma can stop you in your tracks and even immobilize you. 
		Triggers or cues can cause anxiety, like certain places, times of day, certain smells or noises, or any situation that reminds 
		you of the trauma. 
		
		<P>One way to think about PTSD is that this past event is haunting the person now. The haunting nature of PTSD comes out in the 
		re-experiencing symptoms. You often don\'t want to think about the trauma but it can keep coming to mind anyway. Re- experiencing 
		the trauma can happen through very vivid images that are called flashbacks, nightmares, or unwanted thoughts. These unwanted images 
		or thoughts are your body\'s way of trying to digest what happened, since it was so shocking. And because you try not to think about 
		these things, they will keep coming back. This is your brain\'s way of telling you that you need to stop avoiding the thoughts so you 
		can "think through" and organize this experience in order to feel better. 
            
            <P>Avoiding these thoughts is a very common way to try and manage trauma-related pain. The most common form of avoidance is trying 
            to avoid situations that remind you of the trauma. Even situations that are less directly related to the trauma might also be 
            avoided. For example, if the trauma happened at in a crowded market you might avoid public places. It\'s also possible that some 
            thoughts are so intense that you might want to just block them out altogether and you may not remember parts of the trauma. 
            Another way to avoid thoughts of the trauma is by pushing away, not only thoughts, but also painful feelings: emotionally 
            checking out. This can leave you feeling emotionally numb and not able to experience even positive emotions.  This is often 
            very upsetting to your family.

<P>When your body experiences anxiety, it sort of revs you up, like a car. Hitting the gas pedal to get the car moving is similar to seeing 
or hearing something that signals to your body to get moving. This bodily reaction is called fight-or-flight and leads to increased arousal. 
Your heart pounds and you may feel like you are having a panic attack.  It may be hard to breathe. The digestive system shuts down, and your 
palms might sweat. Adrenaline, like a car\'s gas, kicks the body into gear so that you can get out of a situation or protect yourself. It 
probably helped you act and maybe even survive during the event, but in PTSD, this reaction happens even when you aren\'t in danger. Things 
that remind you of the trauma or trigger the same reaction as the trauma cause your body to go into fight-or-flight, making you jumpy, 
jittery, shaky, and easily startled. You might hear a loud noise, and while before the trauma that might not have made you jump, after it, 
you may have a boost of adrenaline and your body is ready to fight or run away. This physical hyperarrousal makes it difficult to think as 
clearly. Your body is in survival mode and you may focus only on what you see as dangerous and can\'t concentrate on anything else or think 
as clearly. It can also make it difficult to calm down enough to sleep. It can also make you irritable and impatient, especially if you 
aren\'t sleeping well. While fight-or-flight is helpful to survival, the extra energy it shoots into our body isn\'t helpful in day-to-day 
life. It can make the world seem full of danger. Another reaction to danger is to freeze and this can also happen during a trauma. 
		
		<P>As we said, irritability and anger are common reactions to trauma. This might be confusing when you feel angry with people you 
		are close to and feel anger more often than you ever did. Not only might you become angry with others, you can become more easily 
		angered in different situations, impatient when things take too long or traffic is slow. You might also be angry with yourself. 
		Some people feel like they should be able to live life just like before the trauma. 
		
		<P>Feelings of guilt or shame are very common following a traumatic event. Sometimes people blame themselves for things they did or 
		didn\'t do to survive or to help others survive. You may feel ashamed because during the trauma you acted in a way you normally 
		won\'t or guilty because you survived while others didn\'t. 
		
		<P>Grief and depression are also common after a trauma. This can include feeling hopeless or despairing. You might cry more often or 
		not at all. You might lose interest in people and activities you used to enjoy. You may feel that plans you made for the future 
		no longer matter or that life isn\'t worth living. This can lead to wishing you were dead or make you do something, or want to do 
		something, to hurt or kill yourself. Along with this, you might grieve the life that you once had or planned to have. If you are 
		feeling this way, please touch this number to talk to someone and get help.
		
		<P>Trauma also can change your view of the world and your own self-image in a negative way. You may tell yourself, "If I hadn\'t been 
		weak or had not done that, this wouldn\'t have happened to me." You might feel more negative about yourself after the trauma. 
		
		<P>It is also common to see others more negatively and feel that you can\'t trust anyone. If you used to think that the world was 
		relatively predictable and safe, trauma can change that view. It can convince you that the world is dangerous and others aren\'t 
		to be trusted. These negative thoughts can make you feel that you have completely changed because of the trauma and relationships 
		might now be tense. If you feel you can\'t trust anyone and if it is hard to feel close to people, imtimacy – both emotional and 
		physical - may also become very difficult. 
		
		<P>This change can impact sexual relationships. Some people find it difficult to want to have sex or even be interested in it. This 
		can be impacted by the change in trust but also because of the emotional numbing. Like mentioned earlier, if you are trying to not 
		feel any negative feelings, this can interfere with your ability to feel anything positive. 
		
		<P>Another way of numbing or trying to change the way you feel is through the use of alcohol or drugs. While there is nothing wrong 
		with responsible drinking, if you are using it to change how you think or feel about the trauma, it can become a problem. While 
		increased drinking or drug use can offer a temporary fix, it often further slows down your recovery and causes problems of its own.

<P>Many reactions to trauma are connected to one another. For example, a flashback may make you feel out of control and cause fear and anxiety. 
Many people think that this common reaction to trauma means that they are "going crazy" or "losing it." These thoughts can make you even
 more anxious. One of the reasons to go over the common reactions to trauma is to point out that PTSD is more than just nightmares and 
 flashbacks. It is also to inform you that as you become aware of the changes that have happened because of the trauma, and as you process 
 these experiences during treatment, the symptoms should become less distressing as you understand more about what you might be experiencing.
